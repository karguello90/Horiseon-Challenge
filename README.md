About:

The Horiseon site has multiple pieces including a header with navigation links, hero banner, content, side content and a footer.
The goal of the project was to create leaner code through use of CSS targets and consolidating divs.

In addition, a personal objective was to better understand how semantic HTML and "drying" code works.
Through trial and error, I learned that semantic HTML makes code more "accessible" or easier to interpret for a fellow developer.

The page has been refactored through use of alt tags, broken links have been fixed, and identifiable tags have been added throughout the HTML.
All in goal to make the page more accessible.

The deployed page can be found here: https://karguello90.github.io/horiseon-challenge/
