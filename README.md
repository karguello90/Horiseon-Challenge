About:

The Horiseon site has multiple pieces including a header with navigation links, hero banner, content, side content and a footer.
The goal of the project was to simplify the HTML and overall code of the webpage. 
This goal was to be reached through the use of semantic code and CSS adjustments to make the page more accessible.

In addition, a person objective was to better understand how semantic HTML and "drying" code works.
Through trial and error, I learned that semantic HTML makes code more "accessible" or easier to interpret for a fellow developer.

My page is distinct in that it has had alt tags added, broken links have been fixed, and identifiable tags have been added throughout the HTML.
